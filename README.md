This application was built during the Music Hackday held in Barcelona, on June 12-13, 2014.

In day-to-day life, we use multiple senses to wade through the world to get the required information. On the web, such activity is very meagerly supported.

Flisound is an app to pull the visual and aural modes of information together to create a rich navigation space that helps users to quickly and intuitively find the required information, in this case a photo/sound. We use Freesound and Flickr APIs to get the sounds and images, and perform content analysis to build and commn network of sounds and images.

The user can navigate through this common space by expressing her/his interest in specific entities. This a very short demonstration video of how flisound works.

This hack is presented by Ferran Mesas and Gopala Krishna Koduri, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.
